# Assignment #03 - 20241209

v0.9.0-20241209

**Description** 

- Develop a solution of the "EBike application" based on an event-driven microservices architecture, applying the Event Sourcing pattern where considered useful.

- Define a deployment of the application on a distributed infrastructure (e.g. a cluster) based on Kubernetes, exploiting the features provided by the framework.

- Consider an extension of the EBike case study, featuring a new kind of experimental e-bike, i.e. autonomous e-bike ("a-bike") for smart city environment. Main features of the a-bikes:
  - can autonomously reach the nearest station, after being used;
  - can autonomously reach a user, asking for the service.
  
  The a-bikes are meant to be deployed into a smart city featuring a digital twin which provides basic functionalities to support a-bike autonomous mobility. Propose a solution, discussing the design and including a demo implementation of a core part, capturing main aspects.  

    
**Deliverable**

A GitHub repo including sources and documentation. The link to the repo must be included in a file ``Assignment-03-<Surname>`` and submitted using a link on the course web site.

**Deadline**
